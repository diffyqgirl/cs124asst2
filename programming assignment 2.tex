\section*{Caching}
When multiplying two matrices $A*B=C$ using the naive matrix multiplication method, the elements of C are given as follows
$$C[i][j] = \sum\limits_k A[i][k]*B[k][j]$$
This is naturally implemented with 3 nested for loops iterating over $i$, $j$, and $k$. There are $3!=6$ possible permutations of their order. I tested all of them experimentally to determine which was best. Runtime measurements were taken by running the naive algorithm on $n \times n$ matrices with randomly generated entries for $n=1200$. 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } 
 \hline
 ordering & runtime\\ 
\hline
 i, j, k &  5.81s \\ 
\hline
 i, k, j & 1.73s \\ 
\hline
j, i, k & 5.54s \\
\hline
j, k, i & 25.30s\\
\hline
k, i, j & 2.05s \\
k, j, i & 24.67s\\
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The ordering i, k, j produces the best results. The caching behaviour of that ordering can be further optimized by saving the intermediate value of each $A[i][k]$ before we iterate over $j$. This allows the innermost loop, with iterates over $j$, to only access a single row of matrix $B$, in order, via calls to access $B[k][j]$. Since the matrices are stored in row-major order, this is very cache friendly. Saving the intermediate value of $A[i][k]$ prevents the cache from thrashing as it must repeatedly load up $A[i]$ to recalculate $A[i][k]$, which is wasted work since $A[i][k]$ isn't changing during the innermost loop over $j$. 


\section*{Experimental Results for $n_0$}
\subsection*{Testing Correctness}
I used the unused first parameter as input for $n_0$ to determine what the experimental value for the optimal $n-0$ is. The program will default to whatever I determine that value to be if 0 is input for the first parameter (as the problem set description said it would be for grading). I wrote a bash script called check to help me test correctness, that would run the program first on an inputted $n_0 < n$, then on $n_0 > n$, and use the shell diff command to check that their respective outputs are identical. When $n_0 < n$, Strassen's algorithm will be used at least once. When $n_0 > n$, only the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm will be used. Therefore, this process checks my implementation of Strassen's algorithm against the traditional matrix multiplication algorithm. 
\subsection*{Runtime for Different $n_0$}
I wrote another bash script called testn0 to experiment efficiently with timing the runtime of different values of $n$ and $n_0$. I was curious if the value of the optimal crossover point might vary with $n$ as well as with $n_0$. It seemed natural to test powers of 2 for $n_0$, and I experimented with several different values of $n$. I averaged over 5 trials to reduce statistical variation.
